# Enhanced UI Experience Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines the comprehensive enhancement of the IEEE document generation application's user interface. The enhanced UI will transform the current functional interface into a modern, intuitive, and efficient document creation experience. The design focuses on improving user workflow, visual hierarchy, interaction patterns, and overall usability while maintaining the application's core functionality.

## Architecture

### Component Architecture

The enhanced UI will follow a modular component architecture with the following key layers:

1. **Layout Components**: Main application shell, navigation, and workspace management
2. **Feature Components**: Document editing, preview, and management interfaces  
3. **UI Components**: Reusable interface elements with consistent design patterns
4. **State Management**: Enhanced state handling for UI preferences and workspace state

### Design System Foundation

The interface will be built on a cohesive design system featuring:

- **Color Palette**: Extended purple-violet gradient system with semantic color roles
