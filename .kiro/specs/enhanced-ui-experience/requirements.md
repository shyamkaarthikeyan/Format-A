# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on creating a significantly enhanced user interface experience for the IEEE document generation application. The current interface, while functional, has opportunities for improvement in terms of user experience, visual design, workflow efficiency, and modern interface patterns. The enhanced UI will provide a more intuitive, efficient, and visually appealing experience for users creating IEEE-formatted academic documents.
